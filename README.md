# Student List

# Introduction 
This Java console application is a simple implementation of a tree data structure designed to manage a list of students. It allows you to create a hierarchical structure of students, where each student can have other students listed under them.

# Features:
- Add Students: You can add new students to the list, creating a hierarchy.
- Display List: The application prints the student list in a hierarchical format, showing the relationships between students.
- Exit the program


# Why this Application was created 
This application was created to demonstrate the basic concepts of tree data structures in Java. It provides a simple and understandable example of how trees can be used to represent hierarchical relationships, like a list of students with their advisors.

# How it Contributes
- To Me (the Developer): This project has enhanced my programming and problem-solving skills through the application of tree structures in Java.
- To the Community: It can be utilized by schools or organizations to effectively manage student or member lists.
